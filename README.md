## Debugging Challenges:
- There are 4 categories of issues to resolve (3 ~ 4 debugging challenges per category):
- [ ] Sound doesn’t play when it should
- [ ] Scoreboard is broken
- [ ] Game doesn’t restart
- [ ] Everything is off-center

In this repo I fixed all bugs listed above. Chromo Dino should work fine now.
